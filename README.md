INDO CHINESE GLYPHCAM — Project Documentation
// I hope i did these languages justice //

Ts a real-time webcam ASCII art converter that renders live video feeds using characters from multiple writing systems. The application captures webcam input and translates pixel brightness values into typographic Indian language characters, creating a continuously representation of the video feed.

Initial Concept
The project began with a basic p5.js sketch that converted webcam input to ASCII art using ASCII characters.

A hardcoded ASCII character set: "($@B%8&WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/|()1{}[]?-_+~<>i!lI;:,^`'. "

The following language datasets the code uses were personally optimised by myself to reduce the random noise effect on the visuals and create visual clarity for the users. The languages are sourced from the entirety of the Indo Chinese sub-continent and were selected in a certain manner to emphasize the concept of diversity within India. The uniqueness of the multiple scripts present within India and its neighbouring countries is very beautiful and a lovely aspect of the country and I hope I did it justice within this project.
